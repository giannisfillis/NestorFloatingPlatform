# NestorFloatingPlatform

The report is written in Greek.
We analyze the Nestor floating platform.

# Details

- 1.1
  We are calculating the symbolic solution.

- 1.2
  We are calculating the transfer function (symbolically) and we are finding the poles and zeros.

- 1.3
  We are calculating the poles and zeros using the given values for each constant.

- 1.4-1.5
  Using the MATLAB program exercise1.m we plot the diagrams.

- 2.1
  We are calculating symbolically the solution for the differential equations using Taylor's Method.

- 2.2
  Using the MATLAB program problem2.m we plot the diagrams.

- 2.3
  Using some substitutions we calculate again the solution using Taylor's Method.

- 2.4
  Using the MATLAB program problem2b.m we plot the diagrams.
